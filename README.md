This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate using [Expo](https://expo.io/) that you can use to save you a couple of days worth of setup, for previous Expo SDK support check out the branches on this repo :).

This boilerplate capitalizes on the use of [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) and it follows Expo's initial project structure that is resulted from invoking `expo init` to create your project, providing you with a great and optimized file structure, organized directories, a great way to maintain your actions/reducers, your assets, configs, API end points, built-in theming, and much more.
Utilities
Expo: A framework and platform for universal React applications.
React Native: A JavaScript framework for building natively rendered applications.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for API calls.
React Navigation: A powerful library for managing application navigation.
Redux: A predictable state container for managing application states.
React Persist: A library for persisting and rehydrating Redux states.
React Promise Middleware: Middleware for robust handling of async action creators in Redux.
Redux Thunk: Middleware for managing complex synchronous logic in Redux.
React Native Paper: A component library for React Native with Material Design implementation.
